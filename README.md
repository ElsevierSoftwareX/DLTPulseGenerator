<b>DLTPulseGenerator</b> - A Library for the Simulation of Lifetime-Spectra based on Detector-Output Pulses

# Introduction

The quantitative analysis of lifetime spectra relevant in both life- and material sciences presents one of the ill-posed inverse problems and leads to most sophisticated requirements on the hardware-specifications of the setup as well as on the analysis algorithms.<br><br>
<b>DLTPulseGenerator is written in native C++ 11</b> (ISO/IEC 14882:2011) and provides the simulation of lifetime-spectra according to the measurement setup: i.e. the kind of detectors (PMTs - Photomultiplier, Diodes, such as APDs - Avalanche Photodiodes) and the acquisition hardware (mostly the combination of ADC and FPGA). 
The simulation is based on pairs of non-TTL detector-pulses which require the Constant-Fraction Principle (CFD) for the determination of the exact timing signal.<br><br>

The DLTPulseGenerator library provides optionally a compilation as static or linked library to make it easy accessible to other programming languages: <i>Matlab</i> (for [mex-library](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/standalone-example.html)) or <i>Python</i> (for [ctypes-library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)). 

# Example using C++

```c++
int main() {
  printf("How to easily implement DLTPulseGenerator library?\n\n");

  /* 1a. Define structs: */
  DLTSetup setup                     = DLTSetup_DEMO; 
  DLTPulse pulse                     = DLTPulse_DEMO; 
  DLTPHS phs                         = DLTPHS_DEMO; 
  DLTSimulationInput simulationInput = DLTSimulationInput_DEMO; 
  
  /* 1b. Set trigger-levels for branch A and B:
  double triggerA_in_mV = 50.0;
  double triggerB_in_mV = 50.0;
  
  /* 2. Initialize DLTPulseGenerator-class: */
  DLTPulseGenerator * pulseGenerator = new DLTPulseGenerator(simulationInput, phs, setup, pulse, nullptr);
  
  /* 3. Receive pulses: */
  DLTPulseF pulseA, pulseB;
  
  while (1) {
    if ( pulseGenerator->emitPulses(&pulseA, &pulseB, triggerA_in_mV, triggerB_in_mV) ) {
      /* all algorithms for exact timing determination and lifetime calculation, respectively, have to be placed here! */
			/* const double timingA = CFD(pulseA);
			   const double timingB = CFD(pulseA);

			   const double lifetime = calcDifference(timingA, timingB);

			   -> binning the lifetimes (MCA). */
    }
    else
      break;
  }
}
```
How to inherit from <i>class DLTPulseGenerator</i> to handle errors using the callback function see [DLTPulseGeneratorApp.h/.cpp](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/DLTPulseGenerator/example/AppDLTPulseGenerator/AppDLTPulseGenerator/DLTPulseGeneratorApp.h).  

# Example using Python

![Generated Pulses](/pyDLTPulseGenerator/PulsesPythonAndPHS.png)

A <b>C/C++ wrapper</b> for <i>Python</i> ([pyDLTPulseGenerator.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGenerator.py)) which demonstrates the usage of [ctypes-library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html), calling functions from the linked library <b>DLTPulseGenerator.dll</b> ([x86](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/tree/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/x86)/[x64](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/tree/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/x64)), is provided.<br>
[pyDLTPulseGeneratorApp.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGeneratorApp.py) calls the necessary functions of [pyDLTPulseGenerator.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGenerator.py) to receive and show up the generated pulses. Additionally, the Pulse-Height Spectra (PHS) are displayed.<br><br> 

requirements: [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 

[WinPython](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/) meets all requirements.
