<b>DLTPulseGenerator</b> - A library for the simulation of lifetime spectra based on detector-output pulses

# Introduction

The quantitative analysis of lifetime spectra relevant in both life and materials sciences represents one of the ill-posed (and inverse) problems. Hence, stringent requirements on the hardware specifications and analysis algorithms are required.<br><br>
<b>DLTPulseGenerator is written in native C++ 11</b> and provides the simulation of (e.g. positron or fluorescence) lifetime spectra according to the measurement setup, i.e. the kind of detectors (photomultipliers or photodiodes) and the acquisition hardware, which mostly consists of a combination of ADC and FPGA. 
The simulation is based on pairs of non-TTL shaped detector output pulses which require the constant fraction (CF) principle for the determination of the exact timing signal.<br><br>

DLTPulseGenerator library provides the compilation as <i>static</i> or <i>linked</i> library to make it easily accessible from other programming languages such as<br>
- <i>matlab</i> ([mex-library](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/standalone-example.html)) or<br>
- <i>python</i> ([ctypes-library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)). 

# How to cite this Library?

<b>You should at least cite the following publication:</b><br><br>
[DLTPulseGenerator: A library for the simulation of lifetime spectra based on detector-output pulses (SoftwareX 2018, Elsevier)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.04.002)<br><br>

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.0

This <b>[release v1.0](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/releases/tag/1.0)</b> relates to the <b>original paper by Petschke <i>et al.</i> published in SoftwareX (Elsevier, 2018)</b> 

[DLTPulseGenerator: A library for the simulation of lifetime spectra based on detector-output pulses](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.04.002)<br>

and provides the simulation of lifetime spectra consisting of <i>discrete specific lifetimes</i> based on detector-output pulses modelled by a log-normal distribution function.

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.1

This <b>[release v1.1](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/releases/tag/1.1)</b> relates to the <b>update paper (v1.1) by Petschke <i>et al.</i> published in SoftwareX (Elsevier, 2018)</b> 

[Update (v1.1) to DLTPulseGenerator: A library for the simulation of lifetime spectra based on detector-output pulses](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.05.001)<br>

and provides the simulation of lifetime spectra consisting of <i>distributed characteristic lifetimes</i> as can be found in porous materials (polymers, glasses) due to their pore-size distributions using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS).

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.2

This <b>[release v1.2](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/releases/tag/1.2)</b> relates to the <b>update paper (v1.2) by Petschke <i>et al.</i> published in SoftwareX (Elsevier, 2018)</b>

[Update (v1.2) to DLTPulseGenerator: A library for the simulation of lifetime spectra based on detector-output pulses](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.06.003)<br>

and was modified to allow the simulation of lifetime spectra consisting of non-Gaussian or any-distributed and linearly combined Instrument Response Functions (IRF) for the PDS A/B and MU. 

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.3

This <b>[release v1.3](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/releases/tag/1.3)</b> relates to the <b>update paper (v1.3) by Petschke <i>et al.</i> published in SoftwareX (Elsevier, 2019)</b>

[Update (v1.3) to DLTPulseGenerator: A library for the simulation of lifetime spectra based on detector-output pulses](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2019.02.003)<br>

and provides the simulation of realistic hardware influences mainly originating from the parts of the A/D converter such as baseline-offset jitter, random noise, fixed pattern and random aperture jitters on the time axis and the digitization depth.

## Software Applications using DLTPulseGenerator library

<b>[DDRS4PALS](https://github.com/dpscience/DDRS4PALS) software</b> written by Danny Petschke

# Example using C++

```c++
#define forever                 while(true)
#define DDELETE_SAFETY(__ptr__) { if (__ptr__) { delete __ptr__; __ptr__ = nullptr; } }

int main() {
  printf("How to easily implement DLTPulseGenerator library?\n\n");

  /* 1a. Define structs: */
  DLTSetup setup                     = DLTSetup_DEMO; 
  DLTPulse pulse                     = DLTPulse_DEMO; 
  DLTPHS phs                         = DLTPHS_DEMO; 
  DLTSimulationInput simulationInput = DLTSimulationInput_DEMO; 
  
  /* 1b. Set trigger-levels for branch A and B: */
  const double triggerA_in_mV = 50.0;
  const double triggerB_in_mV = 50.0;
  
  /* 2. Initialize DLTPulseGenerator class: */
  DLTPulseGenerator *pulseGenerator = new DLTPulseGenerator(simulationInput, phs, setup, pulse, nullptr);
  
  /* 3. Receive pulses: */
  DLTPulseF pulseA, pulseB;
  
  forever {
    if ( pulseGenerator->emitPulses(&pulseA, &pulseB, triggerA_in_mV, triggerB_in_mV) ) {
      /* all algorithms for exact timing determination and lifetime calculation, respectively, have to be placed here! */
      /* const double timingA = CFD(pulseA, level);
	 const double timingB = CFD(pulseB, level);

	 const double lifetime = calcDifference(timingA, timingB);

	 -> binning the lifetimes (MCA). */
    }
    else
      break;
  }
  
  DDELETE_SAFETY(pulseGenerator)
}
```
Errors can be handled by inheriting <i>class DLTPulseGenerator</i> using the provided callback function: see [DLTPulseGeneratorApp.h/.cpp](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/DLTPulseGenerator/example/AppDLTPulseGenerator/AppDLTPulseGenerator/DLTPulseGeneratorApp.h).  

# Example using Python

A <b>library wrapper</b> in <i>python</i> ([pyDLTPulseGenerator.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGenerator.py)) demonstrating the usage of [ctypes-library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) by calling the functions of <b>DLTPulseGenerator.dll</b> ([x86](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/tree/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/x86)/[x64](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/tree/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/x64)) is provided. [pyDLTPulseGeneratorApp.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGeneratorApp.py) calls functions from the library (wrapper) [pyDLTPulseGenerator.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGenerator.py). The generated pulse pairs and the pulse height spectrum are displayed for demonstration purposes.<br>
