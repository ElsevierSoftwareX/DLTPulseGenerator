<b>DLTPulseGenerator</b> - A library for the simulation of lifetime spectra based on detector-output pulses

# Introduction

The quantitative analysis of lifetime spectra relevant in both life and materials sciences presents one of the ill-posed inverse problems and leads to the most stringent requirements on the hardware specifications and analysis algorithms.<br><br>
<b>DLTPulseGenerator is written in native C++ 11</b> (ISO/IEC 14882:2011) and provides the simulation of (e.g. positron or fluorescence) lifetime spectra according to the measurement setup: i.e. the kind of detectors (photomultipliers (PMT) or(avalanche) diodes) and the acquisition hardware (mostly the combination of ADC and FPGA). 
The simulation is based on pairs of non-TTL detector output pulses which require the constant fraction principle for the determination of the exact timing signal.<br><br>

DLTPulseGenerator library provides the compilation as <i>static</i> or <i>linked</i> library to make it easily accessible from other programming languages such as ...<br>
- <i>matlab</i> (for [mex-library](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/standalone-example.html)) or<br>
- <i>python</i> (for [ctypes-library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html)).

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.0

This <b>[release v1.0](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/releases/tag/1.0)</b> refers to the <b>original paper [(Petschke and Staab (2018))](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.04.002)</b> and provides the simulation of lifetime spectra consisting of <i>discrete specific lifetimes</i>.

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.1

This <b>[release v1.1](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/releases/tag/1.1)</b> refers to the <b>update paper (v1.1) [(Petschke and Staab (2018))](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.05.001)</b> and was extended to provide the simulation of lifetime spectra consisting of <i>distributed specific lifetimes</i> as can be found in porous materials (polymers, glasses) using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS).

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.2

This <b>[release v1.2](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/releases/tag/1.2)</b> refers to the <b>update paper (v1.2) [(Petschke and Staab (2018))](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.06.003)</b> and was modified to allow the simulation of lifetime spectra consisting of non-Gaussian or any-distributed and linearly combined Instrument Response Functions (IRF) for the PDS A/B and MU. 

## DLTPulseGenerator v1.3 (not officially released yet)

This version provides the simulation of additional hardware influences such as baseline offset jitter, random noise, time axis nonlinearity, fixed and random pattern aperture jitter on the time axis and the digitization depth [bit] of the ADC.

note: This version isn't officially released yet but can be tested using <b>DDRS4PALS v1.08</b> (dpscience-local repo).

# Example using C++

```c++
int main() {
  printf("How to easily implement DLTPulseGenerator library?\n\n");

  /* 1a. Define structs: */
  DLTSetup setup                     = DLTSetup_DEMO; 
  DLTPulse pulse                     = DLTPulse_DEMO; 
  DLTPHS phs                         = DLTPHS_DEMO; 
  DLTSimulationInput simulationInput = DLTSimulationInput_DEMO; 
  
  /* 1b. Set trigger-levels for branch A and B: */
  const double triggerA_in_mV = 50.0;
  const double triggerB_in_mV = 50.0;
  
  /* 2. Initialize DLTPulseGenerator class: */
  DLTPulseGenerator *pulseGenerator = new DLTPulseGenerator(simulationInput, phs, setup, pulse, nullptr);
  
  /* 3. Receive pulses: */
  DLTPulseF pulseA, pulseB;
  
  while (1) {
    if ( pulseGenerator->emitPulses(&pulseA, &pulseB, triggerA_in_mV, triggerB_in_mV) ) {
      /* all algorithms for exact timing determination and lifetime calculation, respectively, have to be placed here! */
      /* const double timingA = CFD(pulseA, level);
	 const double timingB = CFD(pulseB, level);

	 const double lifetime = calcDifference(timingA, timingB);

	 -> binning the lifetimes (MCA). */
    }
    else
      break;
  }
}
```
Errors can be handled by inheriting from <i>class DLTPulseGenerator</i> using the provided callback function: see [DLTPulseGeneratorApp.h/.cpp](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/DLTPulseGenerator/example/AppDLTPulseGenerator/AppDLTPulseGenerator/DLTPulseGeneratorApp.h).  

# Example using python

A <b>library wrapper</b> in <i>python</i> ([pyDLTPulseGenerator.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGenerator.py)) demonstrating the usage of [ctypes-library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) by calling the functions of <b>DLTPulseGenerator.dll</b> ([x86](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/tree/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/x86)/[x64](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/tree/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/x64)) is provided.<br>
[pyDLTPulseGeneratorApp.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGeneratorApp.py) calls functions from the library (wrapper) [pyDLTPulseGenerator.py](https://github.com/dpscience/DLTPulseGenerator/blob/master/pyDLTPulseGenerator/pyDLTPulseGenerator.py). The generated pulse pairs and the pulse height spectrum are displayed for demonstration purposes.<br>

#### requirements:
- [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) 
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) 
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)<br>

#### [WinPython](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/) meets all requirements.
